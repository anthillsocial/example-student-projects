This is how we wanted it to look - (in this picture the map is a photo) -

## Themes of the game

This project is an interactive map especially designed for the user to enrich his knowledge when it comes to the greatest league in the world, the Premier League. We wanted to create a digital experience about a relevant topic in the world that is interesting and engaging and that would allow the user to expand their knowledge, but also make sure it is interactive as well. We made sure of that by creating an interacive map that includes digital dots that are geographically located at every Premier League club's stadium, as well as every Premier League club owner, with lines that connect between the two corresponding ones. The map allows the user to drag it, as well as zoom in and out in order to navigate their way between the data, additionally, they can hover/click on one of the lines and enjoy some further reading.  

## Use of Datasets

We got our data from various webpages like the clubs' websites, Wikipedia, Google Maps, Datahub as well as the Premier League website. We compared and contrasted each dataset to make sure the data is as correct as it can be, but there were obviously some obstacles on the way. Some of the problems we encountered when we collected the dataset is that some of the information is not always 100% correct and we had to double check and comapre different sources when trying to realise what is the actual answer; For example, we found out the owners have recently changed for Southamtpon. Additionally, we ran into issues in the dataset when trying to put it all on glitch and it temporarily did not show anything on the map due to technical difficulties where the data in each line for each club did not correspond with each other, leaving the data thinking for example that stadium is the same thing as owner, as well as some wrong coordinates, it was solved by carefully going through the dataset, making sure everything is in its place, as well as fixing the quotation marks that were mispelled in some cases.

## Group member role descriptions

Guy - Collecting data, putting in the data in the dataset (co-ordinates, club manager etc.), filling in the README FILE, improving the designs and thinking of colour scheme for the webpage.

Titus - Collecting data, putting in the data in the dataset (co-ordinates, club manager etc.), changing colours of the lines as well as putting in information about the clubs.

Anthony - Creation of the expanded webpage and initial designs, sharpening design aspects and bringing in ideas. 

David :) - Technical difficulties 


## Further development?

So it all went according to plan but one bit - we couldn't get the map to show underneath the webpage rather than what it is now - on top, which makes it look less aesthetic. Also, for some reason one or two of the lines don't work when you hover/click on them. Important to tell you that when you click on the dots - the text appears all the way down the webpage, which is another issue. Obviously with the strikes, it was hard to communicate and for you to help us implement.

With more time, we would definitely have loved to make the map more detailed, with some fancier designs and tools that would take it to that extra level. Additionally, it would have been nice to create an extra interactive layer to the map that would make it feel a bit more like a game.
