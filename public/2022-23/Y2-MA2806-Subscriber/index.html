        The bar graph shows that, with a 51% market share, YouTube Music is the most widely used audio platform in the UK. This indicates that UK listeners are increasingly using the music streaming service offered by the video-sharing platform. With a market share of 55%, Spotify, which is renowned for its individualised playlists and user-friendly UI, is not far behind. With a market share of 21%, Amazon Music is clearly present in the UK market, most likely as a result of its merger with Amazon's Prime membership scheme. With market shares of 15% and 17%, respectively, Apple Music and iTunes demonstrate that, despite continuing to be popular with UK users, they are up against fierce competition from other streaming services. Overall, it is clear that the UK music streaming market is highly competitive, with a variety of platforms vying for the attention of music lovers.

    <h1>THE DEVELOPMENT</h1><br>

   <div class="a"> <p class="w3-large">Throughout the last two decades, the online music market has seen a dramatic transition that has changed how we listen to and buy music. Music is now more accessible than ever thanks to the internet and the development of digital technology.
      
      <p class ="w3-large">
        The days of buying actual CDs from record shops are long gone; today, music can be quickly streamed or downloaded from a variety of platforms as mentioned above. Due to this, the online music market has experienced rapid expansion, with sales increasing consistently year after year. With websites like SoundCloud and Bandcamp providing a place for musicians to share their work, the growth of online music has also provided independent artists a better platform to reach more people. The way we engage with and enjoy music has generally been transformed by the internet music industry, and this trend appears to be continuing.
