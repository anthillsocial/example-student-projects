## Themes of the game

Our project is about anxiety and how countries in Europe compare in term of anxiety diagnoses and why the results are varying, from healthcare funding to cultural stigma and the neoliberalist views of the European Union. It also includes a comparison of the amount of women diagnosed in some countries compared to men, and an investigation in to the results.

## Use of Datasets

__DATASET TITLE:__ Prevalence of anxiety disorders, males vs. females, 2019

__DATA SOURCE:__ Our World In Data

__LINK TO DATA:__ https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/prevalence-of-anxiety-disorders-males-vs-females?time=latest 

 Problems with the dataset include: having to download all the data rather than just the data I needed, meaning I had to edit down from 58,456 lines.
 There were no lat lng coordinates so I had to add these in myself. I also had to spend time adding the male and female percentages together for the first visualisation
 and to find the top and bottom countries i had to write these numbers in to notepad, then use a number sorting program, then figure out what country that number linked to.
 However, there were no problems that couldn't be overcome.

## Group member role descriptions

__Natasha:__

Coded all of the HTML and CSS. Came up with the design and layout of the page. Did research on anxiety and wrote the first paragraph of the page. Did research on the 5 countries with the least anxiety and wrote the information for them when clicked on the map. Found the positive quotes.

__Nicholas:__

Coded all the p5.js code for both visualisations, and drew the second visualisation's icons. Wrote the second and third paragraphs in the beginning. 
Wrote the information before each visualisation. Did the writing and research for the Top 5 countries on the first visualisation. Found the dataset and handled the CSV file including the extra research required.
Did the research and writing on neoliberalism and the research and writing on men's mental health.


## Further development?

If we had more time I would clean up the dataset so there were no arbitrary categories (didn't want to risk creating errors), we would conduct research on more of the countries and try to look 
in to historical events that may have effected. The icons on the second visualisation would've been refined with more time as the women in particualar overlap in an unflattering way.
For the first visualisation, I would've liked to have made a chloropleth map using chart.js and with the extended research, rather than having block colours it could be a gradient going blue to yellow to pink from 
lowest to highest. The page is still quite text heavy, more imagery and condensing of the text may have benefited these sections.
