# Summary of Project:

The main basis of our project was to compare and understand dating apps. This includes exploring the differences in demographics and algorithms between two very mainstream dating platforms - Tinder and Bumble. Due to controversial constraints and privacy, there was a struggle in finding published data about the demographics of its users, so we conducted primary research for this project. This was done by setting up two accounts of the exact same fictional person on both platforms, with all filters turned off in attempts to achieve the most accurate and fair results.

These filters were open to all genders and sexualities, as well as no cap on age limit - allowing it as far as it would go for an ideally more representative study. Interesting factors were found, about which genders and age demographics dominated certain apps, and by how much. 

For a safe, ethical approach - we used a fictional AI character under the name of ‘Lumi’. A 19- year old blonde woman. Initially, a real person was used but that was quickly scrapped for a better approach in terms of safety and ethical reasons. 

In terms of roles, these were split across the group. With some people assigned in charge of carrying out the first hand research; collecting the data, turning it into graphs which was then turned into visual data by other group members. We also had the role of coding assigned to certain members who took up the most of this task. 


# Roles:

Alisha - Coding, Research, Website design & Layout, Narrative Development, Organisation, Analysis, Communication

Mia - Research, Communication, Narrative Development, Collection of Data, Organisation

Sara - Design, Communication, Narrative Development, Collection of Data, Creating and Designing Isotypes

Suha - Analysis, Creating statistics for data, Isotypes, Documentation, Organisation

Dominic - Narrative Development, Research, Communication


Mia and Sara were in control of gathering the first hand data from the dating apps, which they then converted to a more numerical form in graphs on excel to create datasets. This also included generating the AI images for the character we used, and this certainly led to quite a few constraints and struggles.This was gathered by using the allocated 30 swipes that the dating apps give you per day, and keeping track of users’ demographics by screen recording. As well as written work.

Sara and Suha created the isotypes, data graphs and visual forms of the data results that were collected. This includes creating statistics and radar charts.

Alisha was the main coder in charge of coding on glitch, as well as the layout and design for the website. 


# References of key sources of inspiration:

One factor which was fascinating in this project and what inspired it was catfishing. It was difficult to find much public data on the users of dating apps due to privacy laws but one thing discovered was that some people have interviewed users of these apps to gain insight into catfishing - on the receiving end of it. 

Catfishing Phenomenon in the Perspective of Online Dating Services Users (Pramudiarja, Artika, Prabawati) 

It would have been interesting to incorporate the use of AI into this study, but by being a “catfish” into gathering data of user demographics.

# Outlined approach to group organisation (incl, Communication methods - IG chat and in person group meetings), workload distribution and accountability measures.

As for group organisation, our main form of communication was through Instagram group chat which is a quick and easy way to communicate with the group, as well as using its call feature where we could all check in with each other every now and then for small bi-weekly meetings. 


# Description of Agreements for conflict resolution and when to escalate concerns:

There were minor conflicts in methods of capturing this data, with initial suggestions and intentions of matching with as many people as possible and collecting data based off of matches, but later settled on gathering the data based on whoever came up on the feed first, but still achieving a few matches. Additionally, avoiding data collection solely on matches or even interacting with them would cause ethical conflicts, so to have a safer environment for the research project, there was no direct interaction with the users of the apps other than swiping right on them. Just the very basic information of age, gender, race, background etc. was collected.

For example, collecting more personal information on users like profession (if they’re students or businessmen) and location would be an invasion of privacy, as well as leaning towards unethical behavior, so this idea was scrapped and avoided. 


# Values Used in guiding approach to team collaboration:

To do this, we constantly checked in with each other, for feedback and queries for the project - collaborating with each other on opinions and advice on what sort of layouts and design methods to use on the website, or checking in with the progress of data collection and ensuring tasks were completed in time to allow other team members to continue on with their sides of the project.  For example, standard graphs of rough data collected from our first hand research experiment was needed before any Isotypes could be produced. The same applies to the construction of the website. Ensuring that all necessary tasks were completed well in time, this allowed the process to continue smoothly.
