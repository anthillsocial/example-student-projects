    <h2>
      Global Fast Fashion 
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fast fashion is defined as high fashion at a low cost. Manufacturers mass-produce their clothing supplies, which are ever-changing in alignment with the latest seasonal trends; the overproduction of supplies results in retailers becoming overstocked, consequently leading to enormous volumes of textiles waste. As of August 2022, <a href="https://earth.org/statistics-about-fast-fashion-waste/"> 92 million tonnes </a> of garments end up in landfills (of the 100 billion garments that are produced globally each year). Some of the largest fast fashion giants include the Inditex Group brands (Zara, Bershka, Stradivarius, Pull & Bear, Massimo Dutti, and Oysho), H&M, Uniqlo, Shein, GAP, Primark, and ASOS.

      <h2>
        FAST FASHION IN THE UK
      </h2>
      <p>
        Fast fashion is a significant part of the UK fashion industry. It's popular amongst consumers because it can offer fashion at a low price.
        Roughly 1.051 million tonnes of clothes are purchased in the UK each year. 360,000 tonnes of textiles that are thrown away each year in the UK is made up
        of clothes.
        The reason for this is because the population wants to respond to current fashion trends and as a result of this, a clothing garment in worn 
        10 times on average before it is discarded.

        ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF FAST FASHION
      </h2>
      <p>
        When it comes to negative environmental impact, the fashion industry comes in the rankings at fourth. One of the major factors as to why our 
        oceans are having plastics washed up in them is because of the synthetic textiles that these clothes are made out of. Nylon, polyester and acrylic
        are released into the oceans through the washing of items. The production of fast fashion also uses approximately <a href="https://traid.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/impacts_of_clothing_factsheet_23percent.pdf">93 billion cubic metres of water</a>
        every year and the World Bank has claimed that <a href="https://traid.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/impacts_of_clothing_factsheet_23percent.pdf">20%</a> of industrial water waste pollution worldwide derives from the fashion industry.

        The barchart above represents UK consumers who have been asked if they would prefer to buy from sustainable brands over fast fashion brands.
        As seen in the chart, males between 25-44 years-old are more likely to buy sustainable fashion out of the two genders, with females being the gender
        less likely to. This is a positive insight into how the UK is slowly leaning more towards sustainability, but there's still a long way to go.

      <h2>
        THE IMPORTANCE OF SUSTAINABILITY
      </h2>
      <p class="important-sustainability">
        Investing in ethical fashion not only contributes to the health of the planet but also the environment that those who produce the fashion work in.
        Fast fashion companies often may their employees work in poor safety conditions and pay them a wage that they're barely able to live on. The workers 
        are also exploited as they're forced to work long hours and pressured into manufactoring mass amounts of garments everyday. By not buying into these
        companies, you're not supporting the mistreatment of workers and paying for them to be exploited.
      </p>
      <p class="important-sustainability">
        We can also reduce the amount of waste that is generated through buying from sustainable brands. The global production of solid waste is expected to 
        reach a new high of <a href="https://emeritus.org/blog/sustainability-sustainable-fashion/">3.4 billion metric tonnes by 2050</a>. Sustainable brands 
        aim to reduce waste by manufacturing clothes that use long-lasting textiles. This means that consumers are purchasing higher quality clothing that can
        be reused and should not have to be wasted for a long time.
      </p>
      <p class="important-sustainability">
        Sustainable fashion aditionally uses biodegradable materials sourced from natural or recyled fibres. In order to grow, these materials don't require any
        fertiliser, they use less water and energy and don't use any chemical treatment. This results in the reduction of their carbon footprint.
