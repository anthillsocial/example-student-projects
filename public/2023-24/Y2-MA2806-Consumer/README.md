## Themes of the game

This project explores the negative impacts of fast fashion on a global scale, and how the UK can be more sustainable when it comes to fashion consumption. It starts off by giving an overview of what
fast fashion is and how it's destroying our environment to then talking about the importance of sustainability and how a UK consumer can own a more sustainable wardrobe.


## Use of Datasets

We used datasets from Statista as well as statistics from websites such as Oxfam, traid.org, Greenpeace and Planetradio. One problem we had encountered with them is that not a lot of them
could be converted into CSV files in order to produce certain visualisations.

## 3-5 moodboard images

_Images that provided inspiration for your project (can be colour palettes, pixel art styles, images from videogames/films etc)._

## Group member role descriptions

Mary, Fernanda.

Mary: Coded all website elements including visualisations and interactivity. Researched datasets and statistics to include throughout. Wrote content displayed on website.

Fernanda: 
- Researching appropriate datasets/statistics for the visualisation methods we were inspired to use.
- Researched the website's content about fast fashion (globally & in the UK), the importance of sustainability, how to be more sustainable & sustainable UK fashion brands.
- Visuals and aesthetics (created the assets for the falling clothes visualisation and collated the images used throughout the website).


## Further development?

One feature we would've implemented had we have had more time is a timer on the time series visualisation to show the passage of time over one year. 
We also might have included a landmark/other structure to place next to the falling clothes (as displayed in our protoype), and figured out how high the pile of clothes would amount to in a year, to give the user a sense of scale.
