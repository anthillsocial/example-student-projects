## What is the project about?

- The music industry has undergone a significant transformation in recent years, with the rise of online music platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and others. This project is a visualization project that explores different aspects of the music industry and its impact on the online music platforms.

## Use of Datasets:

The data for this project was collected from various sources, including publicly available datasets, APIs of online music platforms, and web scraping of music industry websites. Some of the main sources of data are:

- Spotify API
- Apple Music API
- KWORB
- Statista
- Official Charts Company

While collecting and cleaning the data, we encountered some challenges, such as:

- Inconsistent data formats: The data collected from different sources had different formats and needed to be standardized.
- Missing data: Some datasets were incomplete and required imputation.
- API limitations: The APIs of some online music platforms had restrictions on the number of requests per day, which slowed down the data collection process.

## 3-5 moodboard images:

## Group member role descriptions:

- Both of us worked collaboratively and equally across all aspects of the project. We hoped to create a cohesive and successful interface narrative.

## Further development?

With more time and resources, there are several additional aspects of the music industry that we could of explored, such as:

- User engagement: Analyzing user engagement with different music platforms, including user demographics and listening habits.
- Regional differences: Comparing the popularity of different music genres and artists in different regions of the world.
- Music industry trends: Tracking the trends in the music industry, including new genres and emerging artists.
- Predictive analytics: Using machine learning models to predict the popularity of new songs and artists based on historical data.

Due to the disruptions caused by the strikes in our final week,
we believe that with additional time and support in the lab,
we could have made our project even more dynamic and interactive.
For instance, we could have implemented a feature where clicking
on each platform on the bar graph would bring up a separate box, providing users
with more detailed insights and statistics specific to that platform.

Additionally, we could have addressed minor issues such as aligning
images symmetrically and ensuring that the boxes at the bottom
of the project were properly lined up. Furthermore, we could
have included more diagrams and graphs showcasing interesting
data about the music industry, making the project more
comprehensive and informative. A few touches with the spacing of the text and webpage would also help it to make it look cleaner.
