# Infectious Disease; Covid-related Deaths in the UK

## Project introduction
An investigation of intersectional deaths that occurred in the 
UK during the height of tension and recorded cases within the COVID- 19 pandemic. We want to investigate how reliable datasets are, this being by comparing NHS data, official government data released, and unconventional sources which allowed for first-hand accounts detailing a progress reports as recorded and immortalised using the Internet and social platforms. 

## Creative decisions
We are looking to create graphs that include elements  
such as isotypes to relay the serious information in more  
open-source ways by allowing images to translate data  
that may be overwhelming.

In this way, we also aim to have different types of graphs  
such as bar charts to show the different sources of the 
datasets which will be used, and to provide a multi-levelled 
understanding of the topic.

By intentionally breaking up and disrupting the visualisations with images and screenshots of personal-death accounts that were posted online for the world to see, we are providing an unconventional source that humanises the statistics, and alludes to the deeper stories behind data that cannot be constructed within csv files alone.
Along these lines, the images are in stark contrast to the graphs and will often block out or disorient information for audiences, therefore placing a further emphasis on the importance this type of data can have. By arranging the pages layout as somewhat similar to the NHS and Government websites, we are luring audiences in with something they may recognise (and is stereotypical when considering the theme). in this way, by linking back to the sources where we obtained the statistical data, we allow for audiences to learn their own narrative.

## Groupwork
## Aliza
Largely focussed on code concerning the aesthetics of the site; including layout, external links, and incorporating the theroetical approach.

## Nuh Ali 
Focussed of finding the data sets and sources on gov, nhs, media and more, worked on code sourounding the different graphs and implementing the data. 

## Priyanka
Focused mainly on the research which was gathered on the website.
