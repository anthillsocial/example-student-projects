    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-black"><b>Data sources</b></h1>
    <p> Data about public health in the UK is available on the UKHSA data dashboard. It contains a range of information on the topic, such as COVID instances, fatalities, medical care, and vaccinations in addition to testing. For each topic, there is a multitude of statistics detailing precise and regularly updated data using the largest collection source; the NHS as a mediator of the pandemic. For example, the number of people needing hospital admissions had grown throughout the pandemic, yet weekly deaths were recorded as being reduced substantially since the height of thr pandemic in 2020.</p>
    <p> By breaking down the number of COVID-19 deaths by age, sex, and ethnic group, we are able to obtain more accurate data for specific visualisations to publish the open-source information in dynamic ways. For example, it is recorded that black men are 4.2 times more likely than white men and women to die from COVID-19, while black women are 4.3 times more likely. This comparison demonstrates how racial differences are used to gauge human behaviour rather than factors such as health status or the ability of the immune system to combat infection. And by displaying the ranges of those hit hardest with the disease, our visualisations provide immediate understanding and a human connection to any and all viewers of them. </p>
    <p> UK death toll figures and the causes of the wide variations in the figures over time. For example, as of the end of July 2022, 180,000 individuals had died from COVID-19, accounting for approximately 1 in 8 of all deaths that occurred in England and Wales throughout the pandemic. Keeping track of the fatalities and injuries is crucial as it enables us to determine if the restrictions are effective. This is helpful since it shows how the average has changed or increased each month in a similar trend to the death tolls during the height of the pandemic itself. In this way, the persobal accounts of covid-19 related death 'stories' sourced from social media platforms (which became rife as the consequence of lockdown and working/ schooling from home) allows a new type of data collection where it is almost uncooked as we see the beginnings of a trending culture being formed on what caused the entire world to shift to The Digital at an increased rate.</p>
    <p> Gathering 'pre-cooked' data from largely trusted and reputable sources such as the NHS, the Government, and crowdfunded ventures like Statista, on a topic that is extremely well-documented and still observed to this day means that Covid-19 was a turning point for public interest in their own health as well as others. Over the course of multiple lockdowns and nearly three years, we saw intense debate both in Parliament, and across the World Wide Web; leading to instances where these large databases could collect and organise thought and feeling, converting them into case studies and reports on the intensified human experience that saw many meet their end in isolation and pain, given solace only through being able to share their story to the world on their terms.</p>
