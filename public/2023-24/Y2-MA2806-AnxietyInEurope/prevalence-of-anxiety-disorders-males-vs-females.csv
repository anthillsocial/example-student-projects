Out of the country’s total health care sector only 4% of spending is allocated to mental health care. Mental health is still stigmatised in Czech Republic and this effects thousands of patients which prevents them from getting the help that they need. Miroslava Janoušková from the National Institute of Mental Health said, “I can say that in the last ten years the attitude of the public towards people with a mental illness has been quite negative.” Czech Republic has a 6.78% rate of the number of males and females diagnosed with anxiety combined. This is low as the poor funding means that diagnoses aren't being made. <br>  <img src='https://cdn.glitch.global/f82fc12d-fe6f-4a1c-bac4-506e040d81e6/26b0b960-7228-4b01-81ba-7b3e517667d7.image.png?v=1679525303492'/></p>"

Paul Blokhuis, who was once the State Secretary for Health, Welfare and Sport, prioritised mental health, including giving GPs more funding to work with specialists in mental health to help give treatment to patients. Edith Schippers, who was also once in this role, secured funding for an E-Health system that was anonymous, to eliminate embarrassment and stress from going to the doctors.
