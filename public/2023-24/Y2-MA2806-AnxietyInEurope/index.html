        <p class="intro">
          Anxiety is a mental health disorder that makes a person feel worried
          or uneasy. It can range from mild to severe depending on the person
          and situation. Everyone experiences this at some point in their life,
          even if it is getting anxious about taking an exam. Symptoms of
          anxiety vary from person to person but include feeling restless or
          worried, having trouble sleeping or concentrating, dizziness or heart
          palpitations, having a sense of dread and difficulty concentrating.
        </p>

        <p class="intro">
          This project will look at Europe specifically for several reasons. The
          first is that there are a broad range of opnion on mental health
          throughout Europe, and this is further affected by the European Union
          and their neoliberalist views on healthcare. Another is that we want
          to make sure that there is not an information overload as that can
          cause anxiety, so we are sticking with a smaller number of countries
          to analyse. We also believe that the varied socioeconomic status
          between countries in Europe may contain answers as to why results
          differ, such as poorer countries that can't afford diagnoses appearing
          less anxious than others when in reality if everyone could be
          diagnosed this might not be the case.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
          We also want to look at the difference in anxiety diagnoses between
          men and women in the second part of our project as we want to find out
          whether there is a tendency for women to be more anxious or whether
          men are underdiagnosed because of stigma and social pressure to appear
          tough, and we want to see if this varies too between countries and
          their opinions on male mental health.

      <p class ="info">
        Now that we have covered some individual countries, we will now talk about how the political views of the European Union could be affecting
        treatment and diagnoses for anxiety as a whole. The European union is neoliberalist which is an ideology associated with free-market capitalism.
      </p>
      <p class ="info">
        Thriving on captialism, neoliberalism sees people who do not create profit as cumbersome and all the attention should be put on those who create profit and success.
        Those who suffer from anxiety may struggle to meet these productivity needs, and neoliberalism therefore deems them unworthy of spending money on if they cannot produce money. People
        may not want to seek diagnosis in case they are viewed as an inefficient worker. This pressure from neoliberalism to prove your worth can lead to both physical and
        mental illness itself.
        
      </p>
      <p class ="info">
        There is also an emphasis on measuring your own anxiety through apps that track how well you are doing and there is pressure to improve your score even if you
        do not actually feel less anxious, deeming anxiety as simply something that must be quashed in order to return to work, rather than an actual condition that
        needs proper treatment and time to manage (more time ill means less money made). Neoliberalist ideas believe that any mental health issues are a fault of the individual,
        rather than something outside that could be causing the issue, and medicine is often given in place of therapy as it is cheaper and quicker, and easier to say the chemistry
        of the patient's brain is wrong than to work through their issues.
      </p>
      
      <p class = "info">
        One study showed that being exposed to neoliberal ideologies, such as being in the European Union, can increase the feelings of loneliness
        and decrease wellbeing. A society that makes you feel isolated and alone will give you anxiety if you feel you are not able get along with people 
        because you do not fit their requirements of success.

      <p class="info">
        Looking at this visualisation it does not matter if the country has a
        high or low anxiety rate, women are always at a higher rate of anxiety
        than men. One of the possible reasons for this is the societal views, stereotypes and stigma
        around men and women's mental health.
      </p>
      <p class="info">
      Firstly, have a look at these images found when searching "Men vs Women personality"  </p>
        <img class="image" src="https://cdn.glitch.global/f82fc12d-fe6f-4a1c-bac4-506e040d81e6/article-2082398-0F5722A200000578-729_468x383.jpg?v=1679549195099">
     <img class = "image" src="https://cdn.glitch.global/f82fc12d-fe6f-4a1c-bac4-506e040d81e6/d8fzvhz-7ff90bb2-fbcb-43c3-9b96-6e74c7b8a024.jpg?v=1679549197351">
     <img class = "image" src="https://cdn.glitch.global/f82fc12d-fe6f-4a1c-bac4-506e040d81e6/Sterotypes.png?v=1679549199899">
     <p class="info"> 
       It is evident that there are lots of stereotypes in the media that women are emotional and weak - therefore needing help to tackle this, and men are
       strong and have no emotions- strengthed by sayings such as "boys don't cry". Charities such as Mind, Men's Health Forum and the Mental Health Foundation are
       trying to tackle this stigma as biologically men are capable of having the exact same feelings as women. Nonetheless over 38% of men feel employers would view them as lesser
       if they took time off work for a mental health concern. 
      </p>
      
      <p class = "info">
        However there may also be reasons for women to be more anxious. Because of the harsh beauty standards women are told to uphold
        they are three times more likely than men to suffer from an eating disorder, and 90% of teenage girls feel unhappy with their appearance. In addition to this 
        70% of women have experienced domestic violence in their life and 61% experienced sexual violence in adulthood. If women hear from other women that they have been affected by these
        horrible acts, they may be anxious that it could happen to them with how high the chance of it happening is. Whilst men also experience these situations, because of the stereotypes that men are the abusers
        not the abused, it can be harder for them to be recognised and believed and therefore gain the courage to seek help. 
      </p>
      
       <p class = "info">
         The most chilling evidence that points towards an underdiagnosis in men is the fact that over three quarters of suicides are men, and men more frequently turn to substance abuse. 
         Men tend to avoid seeking medical help for mental health because of the stigma associated with it until it reaches a crisis point, at which point the isolation and pressure can give them suicidal thoughts.
         Men also see drugs and alcohol as a more secretive and for alcohol more acceptable way to manage their emotions, but if used too heavily could also lead to overdose. If men really did not suffer from anxiety (which can lead to other conditions like depression)
         as much as women, then these statistics would not be as heavily male leaning. 
      </p>
      
       <p class = "info">
         Therefore it is imperative that we continue to advocate for men's mental health and to change the social perceptions of men that make them 
         feel like getting support is admitting they are inferior to their peers. Anxiety is a problem we must tackle together.
