## Group member role descriptions

maskeen- My role was to help reasearch and produce the design elements of this project, also to be coding,
I coded the map and the blots on the map. I was also tasked with finding the lat/lng for each place.
I also, although basic, did the HTML and CSS code.

Elisa- My role was to compile all the data and reasearch on this topic. However, it should be noted that much of the data we found we could not visualize. 

Yixi- My role was to compile all the data and reasearch on this topic. However, it should be noted that much of the data we found we could not visualize.

Yuka- I trouble shooted the code, as well as planning the course of action we went for this project. I also wrote 
the text for the website, as well as formatting the website. 
## Further development?

If we had more time we would have included the imports aswell as the exports on the maps interface.
As well as this we would have added to the aethetic of the web page its self. (its quite bland).
We also could have made our map look more sophisticated, like the images in our moodboard. 
We would also size the dots respective to the amount of arms exported to each country to better visualize the data 
that we have. Finally, we would have tried to center the map as well-something we had quite a lot of trouble with.
