        Weapons are a necessity in sustaining the military strength of a country. The ability of a country 
          to maintain its own protection, and furthermore exude strength and influence over other territories 
          of lesser strength bases in its arms strength. Proofs of this lay in the very history of the world 
          itself, with "bigger-muscle" logic running the world even today. Demands for arms has always been 
          high, surging particularly in times of war and other forms of armed confrontation, be it rebellions, coups, or civil wars.<br>  

          Countries with a need of weapons will ask for it. A case study from Quentin Gallea's article "Weapons and war: The effect of arms
          transfers on internal conflict" describes how in 2002, when Spain participated in Operation Enduring Freedom, a war against Al-Qaeda, 
          Angola's imports of weapons fell by almost 90%. Angola, engaging in a civil war at its time, fount itself entering a period of low conflict
          intensity. (Read the article <a href= "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304387822001432">here.</a>)<br>
          

          Weapons imports and exports can greatly reflect a country's military and political situations greatly. Thus, it is important to 
          visualize numbers and statistics of such information to better understand what the numbers tell us.  <br>

        Below shows a map depicting the countries that the US, a major military power of the world, have imported arms to between the years of 2017 and 2019:

      Scrolling out of the map shows the obvious; much of the weapons that the US exports
        to other countries are exported to Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the Middle East and Africa.<br>
        Though it is difficult to discern trading of U.S issued armes after they have left the United States, 
        there are a few things that can be speculated from the data itself. <br>
        For instance, Canada is notably one of the few countries that the US does not export 
        arms to; a fact that could be speculated to Canada's lack of military and/or violent conflicts 
        with other nations, hence the low demand for arms.<br>
        On the contrary, several countries bordering or in close proximity to Russia and China
        also lack arms exports from the United States, despite the rumored conflicts between said countries (for instance, Uzbekistan)
    . This in itself could be read in a different manner; it could suggest that US diplomacy discourages
        involvement with such regional conflics due to its tense relations with China and Russia respectively.<br>
        This information can contrast the heavy concentration of countries with which the US exports arms to in the middle 
        east, a region where it has heavily interfered with armed conflicts and politics.<br><br><br>
        Again, while all these are speculations, if used in conjuction with certain political or military histories and other 
        forms of context, simply examining the destination of US arms tells a great deal of information hidden in numbers and data.<br>
        
        Even by simply scrolling out and viewing the sea of dots on the world map, it is easy to see that the U.S exports to most of the 
        globe, cementing the fact that data visualises what we know: The U.S is a major supplier of arms to the rest of the world. <br>
        <br>
        As such, it is important that we learn to read between lines of code and data, analyzing our information coherently 
        to gain a better understanding of the lucerative world of arms trade.
