## WhatsApp Warriors - A deconstructed podcast

## Project introduction
This is an audio-visual experience using Spotify's podacast software to publicy share private WhatsApp conversations about the social dynamics of Pakistani culture. 
We are taking the conversations off of WhatsApp as the platform is private and encrypted to ensure privacy is kept. Although, we are exploring how 'priavte' our conversations are really kept by publishing them on different applications to explore how 'private' these conversations can remain.
In this way, we are trying to hack interfaces in a similar way to how conversations on the WhatsApp have been leaked in the past.
The personal insight into Pakistani culture is central to using WhatsApp as it is the main commuication system between Pakistanis all over the world.

## Creative decisions
We are combining and mimicking the WhatsApp interface onto our own 'platform' which is a collage of public and closed applications to reveal the systematic limitations we experience using them, e.g., Spotify as a paid platform, WhatsApp is intended for phone-use as the desktop app follows the same layout, content on YouTube has to be both audio and visual, and uploads on Dropbox are only as 'public' as your account is.
Through embedding the recorded conversations onto the page without editing the audio quality (to incorporare elements of WhatsApp in unobvious ways), we are publicly sharing conversatins that are meant to be private.
Whereas by over-laying our thought process 'diary' throughout this project in a format that resembles a WhatsApp chat we are publicising ourselves aswell.
