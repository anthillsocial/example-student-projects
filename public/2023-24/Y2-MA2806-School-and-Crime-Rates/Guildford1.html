   <p style="font-family:verdana">We looked at twenty schools in Guildford. The same across all regions in the country most of the schools were rated good, however Guildford did have three schools that achieved the rating of ‘Outstanding’. This was the most across all parts of Surrey that we looked into. As well as this Guildford did not have one school given the rating of ‘Requires Improvement’ or ‘Inadequate’ which truly shows how good the educated standard in Guildford. Out of all of the areas we looked at in Surrey, Guildford came out with the best standard of education across Surrey.</p>
