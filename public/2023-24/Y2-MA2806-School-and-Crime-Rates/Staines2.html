        The data represented in this graph was collected from  <a href="https://data.police.uk/data/">Surrey Police. </a> By visualisizing the crime rates through a bar graph we are able to identify trends of crime in the Staines area. In this case we see that the crime rates in the beginning of the year seems to be quite lower compared to ones in the middle of the year. We see that at the beginning of the year there seem to be downward trend of crimes from January to March but it begins to rise up again during April to September. With March being the month with the lowest crime rate and August with the highest.
