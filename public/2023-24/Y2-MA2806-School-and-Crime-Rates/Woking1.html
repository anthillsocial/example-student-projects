   <p style="font-family:verdana">We looked at twenty two schools in Woking with the majority of the schools being rated ‘Good’ by Ofsted. This rating is average and standard across the country. However three schools were rated ‘Requires Improvement’ this can be very damaging for the schools reputation and definitely shows the education levels are poor in this area. Woking had the highest number of schools that required improving in the area. Suggesting that the education levels in Woking are not up to standard with the rest of Surrey.</p>
