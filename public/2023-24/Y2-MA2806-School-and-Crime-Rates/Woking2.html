        The data represented in this graph was collected from  <a href="https://data.police.uk/data/">Surrey Police. </a> By visualisizing the crime rates through a bar graph we are able to identify trends of crime in the Woking area. Similar to Staines, we found that the crime rates in the beginning of the year seems to be quite lower compared to ones in the middle of the year. We see that at the beginning of the year there seem to be downward trend of crimes from January to February but it begins to rise up again during April to September and slowly go down again towards the end of the year. With March being the month with the lowest crime rate and September being the highest.
