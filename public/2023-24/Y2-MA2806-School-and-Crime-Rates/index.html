    <p style="font-family: 'arial'"> For this project we looked at both the crime rates and the Oftsed reports of schools in Surrey towns. The goal was to try and understand if there is any connection between the two, and for what reason. </p>
    <p2 style="font-family: 'arial'"> Will a high crime rate impact the Oftsed report given to schools, due to bias? Will a school in an area deemed 'bad' for crime actually be a reflection of that? We hope you will get an insight into that through our research.</p2>
