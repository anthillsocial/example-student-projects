        The data represented in this graph was collected from  <a href="https://data.police.uk/data/">Surrey Police. </a> By visualisizing the crime rates through a bar graph we are able to identify trends of crime in the Dorking area. Firsly, we found that out of the 4 areas we investigate Dorking has the lowest amount of crimes, with an average of around 450 crimes per month. Similar to the other areas we found that the crime rates in the beginning of the year seems to be quite lower compared to ones in the middle of the year. We see that at there is a huge spike of crime rates starting in May before it starts to go down at the end of the year. With January being the month with the lowest crime rate and October being the highest.
