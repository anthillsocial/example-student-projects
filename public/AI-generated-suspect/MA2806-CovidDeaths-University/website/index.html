          The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected various aspects of
          life across different sectors worldwide. Notably, education has borne
          unprecedented upheaval since its outbreak in 2019, particularly
          enrolment and learning patterns, despite the situation showing some
          form of normalcy. For instance, universities in England reported
          102,382 cases among learners and 28,639 among university staff between
          October 2020 and February 2022, suggesting a notable trend among the
          student population (Dack et al., 2023, p. 106). In the United Kingdom,
          the pandemic effects on university attendance have been profound, with
          statistics revealing a staggering impact on traditional learning
          modes. According to a US- based study by Korotchenko and Dobbs (2023,
          p. 1), there was a statistically significant negative relationship
          between COVID-19 and college enrolment for all universities in the
          Texas United States. The current research explores the effects of the
          pandemic on university attendance in the UK, delineating patterns
          before, during, and after the pandemic years (2020-2024). It also
          examines the pivotal role of vaccination efforts in shaping these
          transformations while offering a comparative perspective with
          Pakistan.

          The COVID-19 pandemic has catalysed a notable shift in educational
          paradigms globally. It significantly impacted university attendance
          and academic routines. In response to the unprecedented challenges
          posed by the pandemic, educational institutions worldwide were
          compelled to adapt swiftly to remote learning to ensure continuity in
          learning while prioritising the safety and well-being of students and
          staff (McGivern and Shepherd, 2022, p. 218; Pašák and Palcut, 2024, p.
          1). As highlighted by Korotchenko and Dobbs (2023, p. 1), the pandemic
          precipitated a statistically significant negative relationship between
          the virus's spread and college enrolment. The results underscore the
          profound influence of the pandemic on educational institutions'
          operations. However, other empirical evidence shows that a shift from
          campus-based lectures to digital ones because of pandemic guidelines
          showed a significantly higher attendance rate, revealing the
          effectiveness of online learning (Haugom, 2022, p. 1). Such suggests
          the need for future studies to explore the topic in a broader scope.

            The United Kingdom, like many other nations, witnessed a rapid
            transition from traditional, classroom-based learning to remote,
            online instruction as part of efforts to adhere to
            government-imposed lockdown measures and social distancing
            protocols. According to Dack et al. (2023, p. 106), the government
            recognised universities and higher education settings as
            environments that could permeate sustained transmission. Therefore,
            digital platforms emerged as indispensable tools for delivering
            educational content and facilitating virtual lectures, seminars, and
            assessments. However, the transition had notable challenges. They
            include a lack of access to technology and internet connectivity
            among students, with those from marginalised backgrounds
            disproportionately affected (Gómez-García et al., 2022, p. 2). The
            pandemic-induced shift towards online learning also underscored the
            critical role of digital literacy and infrastructure in ensuring
            equitable access to education. In response to these challenges,
            educational institutions and policymakers endeavoured to bridge the
            digital divide by implementing measures to provide devices and
            internet access to disadvantaged students. Therefore, focusing on
            the effects of COVID-19 before, during, and after the outbreak on
            university attendance is imperative

            Learning activities continued as normal. The standard academic
            calendar included in-person lectures, seminars, and examinations.
            According to a survey conducted by the OECD (2020, p. 5), 92% of UK
            students had a computer they could use for school-related work, a
            proportion that is relatively higher than the OECD average of 89%.
            However, those who reported having a quiet place to study among all
            students and students from the bottom quartile were notably fewer
            (89% and 81%, respectively) than the OECD average (91% and 85%,
            respectively) (OECD, 2020, p. 5). In addition, students had more
            time to study before the pandemic. A UK-based study reported a drop
            in the average time students studied from 6 hours per day before
            COVID-19 to 2-4.5 hours during the first lockdown (Leahy, Newton,
            and Khan, 2021, p. 6).

            The onset of the pandemic necessitated rapid and unprecedented
            changes in university attendance patterns in the United Kingdom. As
            government-imposed lockdown measures and social distancing protocols
            took effect, universities swiftly transitioned to online learning
            modalities to mitigate the risk of virus transmission (McGivern and
            Shepherd, 2022, p. 218; Pašák and Palcut, 2024, p. 1). Remote
            lectures, seminars, and assessments became the norm, facilitated
            through various digital platforms. However, such transition was not
            without its challenges, as students grappled with issues such as
            internet connectivity, access to technology, and adapting to remote
            learning environments (Gómez-García et al., 2022, p. 2. According to
            Leahy, Newton, and Khan (2021, p. 13), student attendance rates
            (between March and May 2020) for those attending school in England
            was 3-4% for primary school learning and 1% for secondary schools.
            Notably, the rate increased during the autumn 2020 term as the
            student population exercised and embraced preventive measures
            (Leahy, Newton, and Khan, 2021, p. 15). The period presented a
            challenge where most students missed in- person school in regions
            affected by high infection rates due to the 'Kent variant' (Leahy,
            Newton, and Khan, 2021, p. 5).

          <p>
            As vaccination efforts gained momentum and the situation gradually
            stabilised, universities in the UK embarked on a phased approach
            towards the resumption of physical teaching and campus activities. A
            study based on the American context found that the growth of the
            number of total vaccinations accompanied an opposite decline in the
            school closure levels, suggesting that more students were attending
            schools following reopening schedules (Hu, 2022, p. 3079).
            Furthermore, learning institutions introduced hybrid learning models
            to offer a blend of in-person and online education to cater to
            diverse student needs. University management continued to prioritise
            health and safety measures on campus. They implemented vaccine
            passports and regular testing requirements to facilitate safe campus
            activities and access to in-person learning (Junge, Samaranayake,
            and Zalesak, 2022, p. 1).

          <h1>Before COVID-19 (pre-2020):</h1>
          <p>
            Schools in Pakistan also experienced distinct patterns. Prior to the
            COVID-19 pandemic, university attendance followed a conventional
            academic calendar characterised by in-person lectures, laboratory
            sessions, and examinations conducted on campus. A study highlights
            that low- and middle-income countries struggled with a learning
            crisis before the pandemic, where their students performed poorly by
            international standards and exhibited higher learning inequality
            (Betthäuser, Bach-Mortensen, and Engzell, 2023, p. 380). Pakistan
            features in the two categories. Baron and Bend (2023, para. 5)
            acknowledge that school learner attendance rates had been relatively
            low before the pandemic. Precisely, 27% of boys and 37% of girls
            aged between 5 and 16 years were out of school, with those in the
            rural areas having higher rates (Baron and Bend, 2023, para. 5).

          <p>
            The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted significant
            disruptions to university attendance patterns in Pakistan. In response
            to lockdown measures and social distancing protocols, universities
            transitioned to online learning platforms to ensure continuity in
            education (Mumtaz, Saqulain, and Mumtaz, 2021, p. 286). Remote
            lectures, video seminars, and virtual labs became commonplace.
            However, a study involving 1280 Pakistani students found that 62.6% of
            them could not distinguish space for taking online classes and 65.3% a
            disruptive and unsuitable environment at home for online education.

            Furthermore, during the post-pandemic era, universities
            in Pakistan began to resume in-person classes alongside online options, with the gradual
            easing of restrictions and improved vaccination efforts. The impact is attributable to a
            relatively higher willingness (72.5%) of taking COVID-19 vaccine among Pakistani
            university students (Hossain et al., 2022, p. 1)
