                <p>Ben Johnson, a 70-year-old male, underwent an MRI brain scan due to recent dizziness and difficulty walking. The scan showed mild shrinkage of the brain, which is normal for his age, and some small changes in the white matter likely caused by long-term effects of high blood pressure and diabetes—common in older adults. There were no signs of a recent stroke, tumor, bleeding, or anything that would need urgent attention. His brain’s blood vessels look healthy, and the rest of the brain, including the cerebellum and brainstem, appeared normal. There was also some mild sinus inflammation, which isn’t serious. Overall, the scan shows typical age-related changes but nothing alarming.</p>

                <p>Sue James, 35, underwent a targeted ultrasound of the thyroid gland following clinical concern regarding a palpable neck lump and recent symptoms of fatigue and weight fluctuation. The scan showed the thyroid gland to be mildly heterogeneous in echotexture, which may indicate early thyroiditis. A solitary, well-circumscribed nodule was identified in the right thyroid lobe, measuring approximately 1.6 cm in diameter. The nodule appears hypoechoic with smooth margins and no internal microcalcifications or suspicious vascularity. No cervical lymphadenopathy was noted. While the nodule's features are overall low-risk, further evaluation with thyroid function tests and possible fine needle aspiration (FNA) may be recommended for complete assessment.</p>

                <p><strong>Report:</strong></p>
                <p>Jake Day, a 6-year-old male, underwent a contrast-enhanced CT angiography of the chest to evaluate persistent fatigue, shortness of breath, and a suspected congenital cardiac abnormality. The scan revealed an anomalous origin of the left coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA), a rare but serious congenital defect. The left ventricular myocardium shows signs of subendocardial hypoperfusion, suggestive of early ischaemic changes. Mild cardiomegaly is noted, and the pulmonary vasculature is mildly prominent, consistent with volume overload. No pericardial effusion or thrombus was identified. These findings require prompt referral to paediatric cardiology, with surgical correction likely necessary to prevent progressive myocardial damage and potential cardiac failure.</p>

       When I first started working in the imaging department, I had no idea how important reports would become. I expected that after a patient had their scan, they would receive a copy immediately or have it emailed to their email address. But this was not the case at all. Instead, scans were delivered to consultants, and patients could only obtain them through their consultant or GP.
Even that process was not simple. Reports were not sent automatically; they had to be manually handled by one person in the administrative department. If that individual hadn't shown up, everything was delayed because no one else had been trained to utilise the system. Due to strict data privacy regulations, reports could only be searched using the patient's EMPI number, not their name, making it much more difficult when someone required their results immediately. Despite working with reports on a daily basis, I was never provided access to them or trained on how to process them.
Patients, consultants, and GPs were constantly phoning to get reports, but the procedure was time-consuming and unnecessary. If a patient wanted their own report, they had to fill out a lengthy form and show identification, which was especially difficult for senior patients who didn't have email access. Even if they were able to complete the process, the results were kept in a specialised format that required particular software to open which most patients did not have. Because of all of these challenges, the majority of patients never received their reports. Sometimes they went missing or were sent to the wrong location, and patients were even given reports for the wrong body part.
It wasn't until I got caught up in a report mix-up that I realised how dangerous these errors may be.
One day, a man approached my desk and asked for help. His consultant had provided him a secure file link to read his report, but it wouldn't open. I assumed it was a simple technical issue and promised him I'd get someone to help.

I searched the department, but no one could assist. The majority of my colleagues were older, with medical knowledge but little technical skills. I had to work things out on my own because I was the only person who was comfortable troubleshooting computers.
We tried everything: restarting the laptop, switching browsers, and reloading the URL, but nothing worked. The problem appeared to be with the software used to view the scan. My instinct told me it could be a file format issue, so I advised opening the report in a different program. It worked, and the man felt relieved.

He returned to my desk five minutes later, however.

At first, I believed the software had crashed again, but he emphasised that the problem was not technical it was the incorrect report. The scan he accessed belonged to someone else.

My stomach sank.
This wasn't simply a little misunderstanding; it was a significant data breach. If he had received the incorrect report, his personal medical information was most certainly transferred to someone else.

Realising the scale of the issue, I quickly notified my clinical lead. When he realised what had happened, he shut himself in his office for the remainder of the day, attempting to mitigate the damage.
By the end of the week, the chief of the hospital in our area arrived for an internal investigation. I was questioned about what had occurred and informed that a legal case had been filed against our department for violating patient confidentiality. What began as a simple request for assistance evolved into a serious privacy infringement with legal ramifications.
This was more than just a mistake; it was a systemic failure. With just one person trained to handle reports, no automated process, and no protections to prevent errors, this type of situation was unavoidable. It wasn't a question of whether anything would go wrong; it was a matter of when.

What is the worst part? It was entirely preventable.

This would not have occurred if the hospital had a more efficient report system, reports that were automatically delivered to consultants, multiple staff members with access and sufficient training, and better safeguards in place.

Instead, one minor administrative error resulted in a data breach, a formal case, and undue stress for all parties concerned.
