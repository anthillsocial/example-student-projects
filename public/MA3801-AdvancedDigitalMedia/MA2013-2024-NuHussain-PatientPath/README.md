## Welcome to Patient Path
A simulated hospital system that shows what actually happens behind the scenes.

Patient Path is a fictional hospital administration tool, yet what it reveals is really true.

This platform is created to look and feel like a functional hospital administration system. At first look, it resembles the clean design of many clinical digital tools, such as patient lists, documentation screens, task panels, and others. But behind the surface, Patient Path is a critical and personal experience designed to highlight the daily obstacles that hospital staff face while using digital technology in real-world hospital environment.

The intention of this platform is not to train, repair, or promote digital healthcare systems; rather, it is to highlight the often-overlooked realities: system crashes, miscommunication, delays, missing data, task overload, and the numerous human workarounds that emerge when technology fails to meet the demands of real-time care. This project is built on direct, hands-on experience working in a hospital setting. It is based on a firsthand understanding of how digital tools are supposed to work and how they actually perform (or fail) when used on busy wards, under pressure, during staff shortages, or with high patient turnover. Patient Path applies that knowledge to replicate those periods of disruption creating an experience that reflects what staff face on a regular basis but is rarely represented in system design.

## How to use this platform
As you explore Patient Path, you’ll interact with a simulated hospital interface. This includes fake patient records, admin dashboards, forms, alerts, and messaging functions. It is designed to behave like a real hospital system but with a twist.

- Systems that load slowly or not at all
- Tasks that become inaccessible midway
- Alerts that arrive too late, or not at all
- Broken links, missing data, or duplicated information
- Frustrations that mirror real-life workflow interruptions

These are intentional moments. They show the often-overlooked hidden layer of hospital administration work in which staff are left to make do with what they have, adapt under pressure, and keep the system running despite, rather than because of, technology. You can navigate the system, try to carry out tasks, and witness what happens when the "ideal" design starts to fail. You may also encounter notes, pop-ups, or visual indicators that show real-world concerns, such as user frustration, departmental miscommunication, or undocumented workarounds. Observe what happens when the platform starts to reflect the chaos that staff deal with every day.

## Now, enter the system and navigate as you would in a real hospital to experience what happens when digital expectations meet clinical reality.
