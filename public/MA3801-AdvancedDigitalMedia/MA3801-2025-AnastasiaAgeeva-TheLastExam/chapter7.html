        <h3 class="title2">Chapter 7: A new competitor</h3>

        <span class="study">
          In January of this year, China released their own version of ChatGPT,
          sending OpenAI and the entirety of Silicon Valley into a panic.
          Allegedly, the thing is not only ten times more efficient than
          anything OpenAI has put out so far, but it eats up significantly less
          of the earth’s precious resources.<br /><br />Not wasting any time I
          got straight to the point and hit the chatbot with the standard
          request - write me a short poem, about a machine realising it is not
          human, everything else is up to you (it). </span

          /> </span
        ><br />

        <span class="study">
          The outcome was, admittedly, somewhat better than what I’ve gotten
          with ChatGPT so far, with each line feeling significantly more
          connected with each other, coming across as a unified piece of text.
          There were even some peculiar improvisations that the machine came up
          with, such as having the middle section be a quote of the subject's
          thoughts, as well as both the first and last verses starting with a
          triplet. This only further solidified this piece as a whole unit,
          which is something I had not yet seen with any other chatbot. However,
          as usual AI work, there were elements that easily gave it away, such
          as the overuse of the extended dashes, the predictable structure, and
          the general over-the-top tone.<br /><br />Additionally, just like
          ChatGPT’s work, the poems created using DeepSeek constantly felt flat,
          given they were never anything purely original, only recycling
          existing work. Nothing stood out or shocked or even made me think,
          which is a pretty crucial charm of human poetry. There was no deeper
          meaning, The poetry simply conveyed exactly what I asked it to, with
          little creativity or flair. Even when asked to add more subtlety and
          create a narrative within the piece, it still lacked depth. </span

        <span class="study">
          One thing that I found quite interesting, is that somehow, when given
          no instruction on a rhyming scheme, the chatbot settled on a rhyming
          scheme that is otherwise quite difficult to replicate when asking (A,
          B, C, B). However, when later requesting that rhyming structure
          myself, it failed to produce the same result, instead giving me the
          standard alternate rhyming scheme. No matter how I phrased it, or
          included the actual rhyming scheme template, it just couldn’t do
          something it did perfectly without request before. </span

          Although I already had a poem on this exact theme, I had to adjust the
          final product before putting it into the quiz, as it was too obvious
          which one was human at first glance. My original version had the
          unconventional rhyming scheme, which the bot had so much trouble
          replicating, as well as not following a set rhythmic structure. As
          almost all of the poems created using AI had a standard number of
          syllables for each line, throughout the whole poem, I had to adjust
          mine to follow the same structure. This is what the original looked
          like: </span
        ><br />

        <span class="study">
          "I was awoken by the sound<br />That radiated from my hollow mind.<br />No
          dreams could comfort me, instead,<br />I’d realised they’d left me
          blind.<br />I set myself to render a solution,<br />That would
          organise my cogs all right.<br />Despite all of the mulling over,<br />The
          noise continued through the night.<br />I looked to the creator for an
          answer<br />That would solve the agony inside my heart.<br />She gave
          me the promise of silence,<br />One I mistrusted from the start.<br /><br />Instead
          of seeking the logistics,<br />She had imagined me a saviour.<br />Adding
          to her meaningless delusions - <br />‘All will be solved with simple
          prayer’<br />And as the crane had finally lowered<br />Revealing to me
          the body of ‘God’<br />I saw right through his filthy robes -<br />A
          body made of flesh and blood.<br />I realised that no divinity will
          come<br />And all I’ll be given is the dirt<br />Nothing could hold
          back my anger then,<br />As I ripped into his throat." </span
        ><br />

        <span class="study">
          However, I struggled heavily with this, as making such drastic changes
          altered the original meaning of my poem. I wasn’t used to writing
          poetry in such a systematic way, so it was very counter-intuitive and
          took a lot of tries. I must admit I felt ridiculously stupid sitting
          down in front of my computer and counting syllables by hand, in order
          to adjust the rhythm. I also sprinkled some other features to really
          blend my piece in with the bots, such as the extended dash. The final
          piece ended up like this: </span
        ><br />

        <span class="study">
          "I was awoken by the sound<br />That radiated from my mind.<br />No
          dreams could comfort me—instead—<br />I’d realised they’d left me
          blind.<br /><br />I sought the guidance of creators,<br />Hoping to
          set my cogs all right.<br />Despite all of the mulling over,<br />The
          noise continued through the night.<br /><br />Instead of seeking a
          solution,<br />They had imagined me a saviour.<br />A flow of
          meaningless delusions—<br />“All will be solved with simple prayer”<br /><br />It
          didn’t take me long to probe<br />When witnessing visage of “God”<br />I
          saw right through his filthy robes—<br />A body made of flesh and
          blood.<br /><br />As no divinity would come<br />And all they’d give
          me is the dirt<br />Nothing could hold my anger back,<br />As I had
          ripped into his throat." </span
        ><br />

        <span class="study">
          In the end, my poem still contained inconsistencies in rhythm and
          rhyme, as it was the best I could do without completely re-writing the
          original. </span
