        A few months ago, the Center for AI Safety, together with Scale AI,
        created what they titled “Humanity’s Last Exam”. The unnecessarily
        intimidating title refers to a language model benchmark that is
        supposedly the hardest yet, stumping most AI programmes and allegedly
        being the final barrier before we reach irreversible consequences of AI
        advancement. </span

        This whole ordeal inspired me to create my own “last exam”, targeted at

        The format is very simple, you will be shown two pieces of text - one
        made by a human and one made by a machine. Your task - guess which is
        which. For a total of 7 rounds. After each round you will get a chance
        to reveal a small breakdown of each text that will, hopefully, provide
        you with tips on how to identify if something was written by AI. You can
        choose to look at it, or, do the whole test without help - lucky for
        you, you have free will. If you are ready, click start. </span
