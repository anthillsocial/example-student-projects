          Having been disappointed by the first experiment, I started slowly
          introducing more instructions into each prompt, to see how far I can
          stretch the chatbot’s ‘creative freedom’. After establishing a rhyming
          scheme and a general theme, I made my first request. </span
        ><br />

        <span class="study">

          /> </span
        ><br />

        <span class="study">
          As usual, the product contained mentions of light, sound, and the
          environment. It was even nice enough to identify the rhyming scheme
          for me in brackets after each line. I also noticed that each poem was
          always accompanied by a title, which was always straight and
          to-the-point, directly referencing the content.<br /><br />Despite the
          morbid theme, the bot somehow managed to come to an optimistic
          conclusion, noting how death is just a beginning and it happens to all
          of us. Unless specifically asked, the bot will always default to a
          positive tone, unless directly asked otherwise, which is what I did
          with my next prompt. </span
        ><br />

        <span class="study">
          <img
            class="proof"
            src="https://cdn.glitch.global/d99483b0-6461-4e7f-af1a-e492fafaa077/Screenshot%202025-05-11%20at%2016.57.21.png?v=1747063493164"

        <span class="study">
          The result was near-identical to the last in all aspects, except it
          was, indeed, pessimistic like I had asked. This was enforced by the
          eerie title and 100 “no’s” that made it very clear that this was a
          negative poem. At this point I was getting tired of the whispers, the
          echoes, and the dark, which were getting shoved into every piece like
          a requirement.<br /><br />I got curious at how the bot would do with
          an absence of a rhyming scheme, so I requested a free-verse poem. </span

                What was interesting about this, is that while I didn’t give it
                a theme, it settled on one from my previous requests, where I
                played around with haiku’s (spoiler!). The theme for those was
                time and truth, which this piece followed quite faithfully. It
                included all of the keywords I required in the other requests -
                past, present, future, truth, and lie - splitting them into a
                stanza each and simply defining them through metaphors and
                personifications. The only downside is that the poem felt quite
                random, with each stanza having little to do with the previous.
                Although the sections themselves had a confined meaning, the
                whole piece lacked continuity, and when read as whole, came
                across as quite nonsensical.<br /><br />Overall, I preferred the
                free-verse poems a lot more than the other rhyming schemes, as
                they felt a lot less programmed, because there was no set
                repetitive structure. This at least gave off the impression that
                there was some level of improvisation, even if that too, was
                fake.
