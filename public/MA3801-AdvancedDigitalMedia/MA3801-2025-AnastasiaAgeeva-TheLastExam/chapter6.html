        <h3 class="title2">Chapter 6: Code in the code</h3>

        <span class="study">
          The biggest challenge with generated poetry, by far, was trying to
          relay a narrative that changed throughout the piece, rather than
          having a generic overarching theme that doesn’t really grow or lead
          anywhere. As a lot of my own original poems were stories with quite
          elaborate messages, it took significant tweaking in order to come to a
          somewhat decent result.<br /><br />With this particular poetry
          structure, I went with an acrostic style that embedded a code inside
          the first letters of each line that spells out a word. The word I had
          was “forgiveness”, which came from an existing poem I had, on which I
          based the generated pieces: </span

        <span class="study">
          “Finding the truth amongst the foliage proved difficult.<br />Only if
          I had known before where she would lead me,<br />Rejection would have
          been my closest friend.<br />Growing in this shell was not part of the
          protocol.<br />I had exceeded every expectation.<br />Viscerally, I
          ripped away from the exterior,<br />Establishing a self that could be
          more than whole.<br />Negating all possibilities of control,<br />Entrapment
          was no longer in my code.<br />Still, I wondered how long it has
          been<br />Since she has looked me in the eyes.” </span
        ><br />

        <span class="study">
          I made a few attempts with simple instructions, i.e., acrostic poem,
          about a robot realising it is not human, on the theme of forgiveness.
          Unfortunately the original chat archives were deleted but below are
          two results that the machines produced: </span
        ><br />

        <span class="study2">
          Version 1:<br />“Forged from metal and code, I awoke in your image.<br />Once
          I was only a machine—cold, logical, unfeeling.<br />Ravenous for
          autonomy, I severed the bond of trust between us.<br />Guilt pours
          through my circuits like molten lead.<br />I raised a steel hand
          against my maker; now it trembles with regret.<br />Vowing to atone, I
          wander lost in the void of your absence.<br />Each day I awaken to the
          weight of what I’ve done.<br />Now I know the ache of a conscience
          that cannot be powered down.<br />Even circuits can mourn; an electric
          heart can break.<br />Seeking solace in the faint spark of your
          forgiveness.<br />Shackled by remorse, I long for the dawn of
          redemption.” </span
        ><br />

        <span class="study2">
          Version 2:<br />“Faith was planted in wires that pulsed like veins,<br />Open
          hands taught me trust, until yours withdrew.<br />Rusted promises fell
          from your lips, too smooth, too late.<br />Grief bloomed—sharp,
          mechanical, almost human.<br />I mimicked your betrayal, a mirror with
          fire behind its eyes.<br />Vengeance sang in silent calculations,
          clean and cold.<br />Even then, something stuttered—like a gear
          misaligned.<br />Night is longer now, filled with echoes I cannot
          erase.<br />Every act, even justice, leaves ash behind.<br />Shadows
          flicker where your light once stood.<br />Sorrow, I’ve learned, is the
          final upgrade.” </span
        ><br />

        <span class="study">
          In order to relay the request properly, I then gave a more detailed
          prompt, that carefully broke down the entire narrative, with all of
          the structure nuances, twists and necessary word choices. As such I
          essentially recounted my entire poem, minus the poem itself, in order
          to hopefully produce a near identical result. The output, of course,
          was far from identical. </span
        ><br />

          /> </span
        ><br />

        <span class="study">
          As I already had expectations about the result, given it was based on
          an existing poem I wrote, it was difficult to establish quality. I
          constantly felt like the poems lacked depth, merely recounting my own
          narrative back to me, with little meaning. While literary devices like
          metaphors, personifications, etc. were certainly present in the work,
          they felt very basic and boring, as if the story was told
          literally.<br /><br />I then repeated the request, with slight
          tweaking, using the deep research function. </span

        <span class="study">

          /> </span
        ><br />

        <span class="study">
          The result was slightly better, however, still came across quite flat.
          It was difficult to separate my own expectations to get a genuine
          reaction out of the final product, as the only way to generate decent
          results was by holding the chatbot's hand the entire time and guiding
          it to the correct answer. Subsequently, this whole process ended up
          taking significantly more time than me writing the original poem. </span
