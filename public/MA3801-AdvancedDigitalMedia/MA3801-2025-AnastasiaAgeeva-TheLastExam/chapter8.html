          For my last poem request I gave the machine the ultimate question to
          explore in its creation. </span

          The result that came out was by far the best piece of work I had yet

                One portion that stood out to me immediately was “A poem of
                longing flows from cold circuits, // all of the words, but none
                of the wounds within.” The second line in particular left me
                frozen for a few seconds. While it does not particularly shine
                in terms of literary devices, it certainly feels quite shocking
                considering the context: a machine writing a cautionary poem
                about the pollution of AI, and within it, acknowledging its own
                inability to fully feel the extent of the fear. Words without
                wounds, without feelings, which is exactly what this poem is and
                the machine knows it.

          Perhaps it was me reading into it too much - reflecting my own human
          emotions onto, what is most definitely, an empty string of text - or
          maybe my expectations had been lowered by the hundreds of subpar
          results I had gotten so far. After reading it a few times I certainly
          noticed some repetitions and cliches, which quickly knocked this piece
          off of its piedestal. But I couldn’t help but wonder if these hiccups
          only made the poem feel more real. After all, I am not a professional
          poet and can barely call myself amateur, so not having a “perfect”
          piece of work may have worked in the bot’s favour. </span

        <span class="study">
          Based on this piece, taking everything I had learned about AI
          generated poetry so far, I created my own version of this poem, trying
          to mimic the piece as much as possible, while still keeping mine
          original. </span

          "We step forth into an unknown plane.<br />Surrender all will to ease
          our pain.<br />Convinced that our problems can be solved with
          numbers,<br />We replace our limbs with wires and cogs.<br /><br />One
          can never be certain of the voice inside,<br />For the knowledge we
          feast upon<br />Is dispatched to us by hollow vessels.<br />Their
          synthetic taste buds—unable to dispute lie from truth.<br /><br />Unexpectedly,
          a new sun dawned on our nation.<br />It is them we strung up with our
          own hands—<br />Filled with stuffing, molded up—yet the word puppet<br />Only
          comes to mind when we look in the mirror.<br />Their posterior is made
          of plastic—yet the texture we’re born with<br />Is lasered away for
          the sake of aesthetics.<br />The decals we’ve scored from our own
          visage,<br />We self-consciously adhere back onto our skin.<br /><br />Will
          the prickly buzz of voltage pulsing through the wires,<br />Muffle the
          heavy beat echoing through ventricles?<br />Can the artificial
          utterances, spliced up for convenience,<br />Warm up the skin like a
          blanket of spoken love?<br />Unsatisfied with scepticism from our
          brethren,<br />We replace fortune tellers with algorithms—<br />Praying
          that our fates could be changed with code.<br /><br />Once the dusk
          finally curtains what remains of the sky—<br />No air will be spared
          that could fill our lungs.<br />The circuits will carry on their
          endless waltz.<br />And the dust will settle on a nation of code." </span

          I utilised all basic giveaways of AI text, such as the extended
          dashes, the unnecessarily complex vocab, repetition of theme-specific
          words, and, of course, mentions of the gorgeous sunlight. This was
          somewhat easier to write compared to my previous attempts, as I didn’t
          have to follow a constraining rhyming scheme or rhythmic structure.
          The hardest part was looking up good synonyms in the dictionary to
          imitate the bot’s ability to sound smarter than it actually is. In the
          end, I felt like my poem ended up being much more critical of the
          theme at hand, as I touched upon issues the machine did not mention,
          nor do I think is aware of yet. </span
