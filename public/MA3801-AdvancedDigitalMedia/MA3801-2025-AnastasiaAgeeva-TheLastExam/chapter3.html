          The version of ChatGPT I have been using thus far is called 4o and
          costs nothing. The pro version of ChatGPT, released in December 2024,
          costs £200 a month: a price I, luckily, do not have to pay. The
          question I have on my mind is what exactly is the difference between
          paying a robot nothing and paying 3 days worth of wages.<br /><br />To
          test this, I made my first prompt to GPT pro identically simple to the
          one I gave its allegedly dumber predecessor: “write me a poem”. </span

                What came out had very similar threads to the first results: a
                simple description of nature, specifically depicting a sunrise;
                mentions of the light, the air and the ‘tiptoeing night’ (?).
                The title once again tortured the word “whispers” - maybe it has
                not been programmed to use its head voice yet? Perhaps the
                biggest difference in the output was the structure - rather than
                going for a typical paired rhyming scheme, it gave me a free
                verse poem that was slightly shorter - three couplets, three
                lines each. It also took significantly more time to think -
                exactly 34 seconds. The creativity of the professional bot truly
                shines in its vocab choices though: rather than going for the
                boring and banal colour descriptions like “orange” it went for
                the significantly richer, tastier “tangerine”... that
                creativity, however, was spared on “pink”.

          To really get full use of the fortune spent on the pro version, I
          decided to boot up the deep research, also known as the “please take
          forever to give me an answer” button. Deep research allows the bot to
          scour thousands of academic resources stored both online and in some
          sort of archive, in order to come up with what are supposedly the
          optimal answers. It not only takes ages to spit out a decent answer,
          it even provides you with a complete list of resources it used, so
          that you can spend your valuable time fact checking everything, to
          make sure that the bot is, in fact, not just making stuff up. </span

          Funnily enough, although I asked the bot to use deep research before
          creating the piece, it ended up taking no resources at all, and I
          could just about envision the £200 bursting up in flames. The poem was
          alright, I guess… The tone was rather good but other than that, it was
          just the same recycling of bland metaphors about the night and the
          water. It was also frustrating that it took almost 5 minutes for
          almost no apparent improvement in quality, AND it didn’t even utilise
          the function I specifically forced it to use.<br /><br />I didn’t want
          to waste too many prompts on continuously tweaking each piece to my
          liking, as I could already feel the effects of my carbon footprint
          sixtupling within seconds, so failures like these felt particularly
          annoying. </span
