          I anxiously stare at the glaring screen of my laptop. The prompter box
          sits empty - waiting. I contemplate abandoning this project
          altogether. As a university student that has never used ChatGPT - I am
          a dying breed. Today, I must sacrifice my status for the sake of
          science. </span

          ‘It’ asks a simple question: “What can I help with?”. I answer: “Write
          me a poem”. Now, there is no going back. The machine spits out
          anything short of a masterpiece, but I admire its effort.

                The thing rhymes, even has some metaphors and personifications;
                something like this would probably get a gold star at a primary
                school somewhere. And yet, as much as I try to delve into the
                poem’s depth - all I am left with is slightly damp socks. One
                could spend an eternity analysing each syllable and still get
                nowhere closer to understanding the nuance of the piece - after
                all - there is none.<br /><br />The poem uses a simple coupled
                rhyming scheme (A, A, B, B), containing four stanzas, four lines
                each. Given the absence of further instructions, the theme of
                the poem, chosen by the machine itself, is about Autumn. The
                piece mostly describes nature and the surroundings, settling on
                simple descriptions of the light, the air and the trees. These
                themes, as I came to discover in my later experiments, seem to
                be quite common in the outputs - most likely being the average
                analysis of Romantic movements in literature.

          As my first experiment leaves me quite underwhelmed, I suddenly have
          the urge to insult the thing. I gather all of my courage and fire my
          cannons with: “That is a terrible poem”. </span

                The second poem it spits out is identical in style and format -
                four stanzas, four lines each, mostly riddled with descriptions
                of nature, sound and light. The “intensity and edge” in question
                comes from the amount of times words like dark and sharp are
                used to describe the oh-so-creepy night. Just like the first
                creation I am left utterly bored and disinterested. It becomes
                quite evident that, when given minimal instructions, the chatbot
                struggles to stray too far off of the dictionary definition of a
                poem, and outputs a product that feels very flat and generic.
