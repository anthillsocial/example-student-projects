        Chapter 4: Humour me this
      </h3>
      
      <span class="study">
        Aside from the rich world of poetry I wanted to test the chatbot's creativity in other areas, and what interested me most is its ability to make someone with feelings laugh. I asked the thing to tell me a joke. I guess it was worried about being offensive, so it decided to play it safe and joke at the expense of its own kind.

          Then I asked it to give me a random theme, to which it gave a generic yard sale joke-book knee-slapper.

          The emojis were honestly the funniest part of the work, as they reminded me of the very familiar feeling of hyping up your own joke over text, after realising it was not as entertaining as it seemed in your head.

        <span class="study">
         With my third request I booted up the deep research function. The bot must’ve felt how unimpressed I was with its work that it decided to go above-and-beyond the original brief, in order to earn my validation, spitting out a whole essay. The essay used 13 resources in total, from standard places like wikipedia, quora, and reddit, as well as some random sites I’ve never heard of before, the reliability of which is difficult to establish. In it, the bot not only gave me a joke, explained said joke to me in detail, but even went on a whole rant about “what makes a joke clever”. I was honestly offended; the concept of a robot that doesn’t even have the capacity to laugh, explaining the definition of a joke to me, was an interesting situation I never imagined myself being in, and was funny in and of itself.
