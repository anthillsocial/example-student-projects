          Chapter 3: Expanding the beast's cultural knowledge
        </h3>

        <span class="study">
          One type of poetry I found particularly fun to play around with was
          the Japanese Haiku. As the structure of this art form is very specific
          and constrained, it became an interesting challenge to see how much
          the AI could do with the limited word count.<br /><br />At first I
          gave the bot freedom to improvise the content and you are not going to
          believe the theme it chose… </span
        ><br />

        <span class="study">

          Once again, the output was quite generic but fit the brief otherwise,
          using the correct syllable count. The only problem, aside from the
          theme, seems to be that the AI struggles to connect the lines into a
          coherent story, which is something evident throughout all of the
          poetry styles, especially when minimal instructions are given. What
          often ends up happening is that the machine produces a piece of text
          where each stanza, pair, or even a single line, can be shuffled around
          in whatever order and, ignoring the rhyme, would make equally as much,
          or evidently little, sense.<br /><br />After the first try, I decided
          to narrow down the content, basing it off of a poem I wrote: </span
        ><br />

        <span class="study">
          “Truth sits in the past,<br />the present holds the questions,<br />future
          is a lie.” </span
        ><br />

          Both results were decent but were quite meaningless compared to my
          piece, again struggling to create a united message. I then moved over
          to the pro version and asked it to specifically include all of the
          necessary keywords that feature in my poem, however the results were
          even more nonsensical. </span

          Even though I was convinced my Haiku was quite simple and intuitive,
          no matter how much I tried to push the chatbot into the right
          direction, it always missed, even when given all of the necessary
          ingredients. It was only when I essentially explained the entire piece
          to it that it finally managed to make something close to my idea, but
          even then, it couldn’t help but mention the silence (???). </span
