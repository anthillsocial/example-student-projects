This project was created with the purpose of learning about the rise of manga in comparison to the fall of comics. the original idea for the work came from each group member’s background engaging with both forms of media as we have personal collections of both and visit stores to expand our collections and interact with likeminded individuals.

To make the data more balanced, we decided to compare manga series to comic books characters as comic runs start, end and can at times run simultaneously to one another whereas manga goes from chapter 1 and continues onwards with little confusion.
The manga series chosen were; Hunter x Hunter, One Piece, Dragon Ball Super,  Naruto and Solo Levelling. The comic book characters chosen were; Batman, Superman, Spider-Man, X-Men and the Fantastic Four.

Furthermore, we chose to use the timeframe of 1997 to 2024. The 27 year timeframe not only lines up with the most recent completed year but also the creation of the oldest manga series on the list (One Piece)

The roles of each team member within the project are as follows;
-

Aiden’s role was to investigate and note his findings on the rate of physical and digital sales of both manga and comic books within the set timeframe.

Daniel’s role was to investigate and note his findings on the number of searches for each series/character in comparison to new content being released for each franchise.

Oscar’s role was to investigate and record his findings on the popularity of each character (which will be determined through the number of searches) in comparison to total sales of manga series or comic books featuring the character in question.

Joel’s role was to focus on the programming and design of the webpage in accordance with what was agreed upon during team discussions to ensure no major decisions were being made alone.
