For my movemenets piece I wanted to begin by making a simple loop of bubbles rapidly rising. Then I felt tha I wanted to include some sort of artwork to appriciate what people do and stumbled along a piece by an artist called 'Olga Nikitina'

Olga is a painter and scuba instructor and she paints her pieces under the water and i found this extrodinary. It turns out to be as simple as using a pallete knife and water resistant paint. Here is a link o her website:
