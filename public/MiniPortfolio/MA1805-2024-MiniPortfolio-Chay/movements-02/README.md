So, My IDEA is basically, bubbles & colour I wan random bubbles with a random colour to like follow the mouse and when you click, THEY POP and the ackground changes to that colour accordingly. and i also want to add words on top o all of it somehow but after maybe. 

um i will start with trying to get the bubbles working. I was a little stcuk on how to do random movements bu stick to the same y axis so i moved onto the colour of the bubbles. So I managed to get the random colour working and am currently working on the 'spawn' location of the bubble. 

Tom helped me understand that the spawn location should be done under setup instead of within the loop and therefore we can set the movement to something random compared to just the spawn location. 

Through the error, i noticed the increase in speed created a very interesting pattern so instead of resetting it and letting it play, it creates soemthing new. The loss of control is very interesting to me. The fact that if i lower the speed  (count) tremendously, we can see the bubble rise faster and faster. 

opinions on adding 2 bubbles and each signified by colour and you have to pop the right one and avoid the wrong one. 

For my movemenets piece I wanted to begin by making a simple loop of bubbles rapidly rising. Then I felt tha I wanted to include some sort of artwork to appriciate what people do and stumbled along a piece by an artist called 'Olga Nikitina'

Olga is a painter and scuba instructor and she paints her pieces under the water and i found this extrodinary. It turns out to be as simple as using a pallete knife and water resistant paint. Here is a link o her website:
