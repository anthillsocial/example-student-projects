Collions to me feels quite aggressive. Colliding?! like surely that would create quite the impact. Therefore, for my collision prompt I wanted to do something calmer, more tranquil, more peacful. Then it hit me like a pebble. Skipping stones.

so now I put a pond image in the background and the collision is this fun little game where you intercept the onrush on pebbles before they reach the end with our own (slightly more high defenition) pebble. 

i am also proud of the coring system and how t resets back to zero!
