# My Drawing Project  
   
## The Target 
   
   
   
   
    **  This is my first project in VS Code or in any coding language besides some C# ever. I want to focus on making the target as accurate as possible to the refrence picture and only once i feel that it is of a high quality may i move on and try another. So far i have made the rings and backfground as well as their colours. I also tried to add a lighter red towards the inside of the shape as seen in the photo by using a filter (BLUR, ) function. I feel more confident in using this now. 
    
    I want to try and add texture to the rings and background itself now and will use the p5.js refrene to aid me as far as possible! I have looked through and feel that noise may create an effect similar to what i am looking for, so i will try utilise it. It was a loop and did ot end up working but its ok, i will try and look for another way to add some texture. Whether that may be through small shaped randomly generated ontop or another option. ** 
   
    I am REALLY happy with the glow (it is a square and not a circle but nobody has to know)
