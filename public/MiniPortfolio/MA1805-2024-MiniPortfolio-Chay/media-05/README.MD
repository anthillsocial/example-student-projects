For my final piece, I wanted to capture the essance of he basic, lowly uni kitchen and how it changes. So i just took some photos on some nights where the kitchen was mostly free and recorded the audio to get a feel of the place I call home. 

Furthermore, I wanted to utilse this prompt to learn how to alter things based on where you click specifically because in my future game/art piece I will be utilising this mechanic!

You have to click on the light on each picture but I wanted to purposfully not make that obvious so it is less based on clicking and more staying there and absoring the feel of the image and sound. (sound did NOT agree with this)

thank you for reading !
