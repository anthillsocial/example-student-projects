Inspiration: I wanted to create loop in which shapes fall and change in specific parts of the canvas. This better demonstrates the use of Arrays by including a colour array, a shape change array and arrays used for the X axis and y axis of the 3 shapes.

Inspired by BodaMat falling shapes game. 

Struggles: I orginally wanted there to be 3 shape changes where the last shape change was a triangle. However, instead it created this interesting spiderweb like effect where 3 lines are drawn and follow the shapes down the canvas. I chose to stick with this because it looked original and unique.

Outcome: I now have 3 changing shapes that go down the canvas, whilst changing colour when it spawns back at the top. Adding on, a line that follow each shape continuiously.
