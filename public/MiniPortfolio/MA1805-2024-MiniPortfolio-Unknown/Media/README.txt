Inspiration: I wanted to create a sort of visusal representation of a storm without using vidoe, but a cycle of different images that create the appearance of it. The images are taken using a mobile phone camera, and are close up pictures of materials such as leather, wood from table and fabric from a jumper. I then used a grey filter on it to give it a colour scheme of a dark grey storm. 

Struggles: Originally i was going to use longer and complex sound download to simulate the sound effects of a storm, however p5.js struggled to load it onto the canvas due to it containing too much memory. So i had to choose a more simple sound that was easier to run whilst being able to interact with the canvas.

Outcome: I now have a images that interchange where the mouse goes past the canvas with the sound of the storm as background music for a short while. The close images of materials have created interesting textures that provide a more abstract art outcome.
