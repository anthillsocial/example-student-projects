Inspiration: I was surfing through the p5.js reference to find interesting functions as i was not completely sure what to create. I came across 'constraint' as a function that essentially creates barries to an object. I then got an idea of making a simple prison with lines to trap the avatar circle inside, limiting its movement across the canvas. This could be seen a representation of entrapment and helplessness. 

Struggles: My strokeWeight and circle fill was changing colour together instead of seperate. This was because rgb and sft variables were the same random values. I fixed this by changing the sft values to a different number - creating different colours compared to the circle fill. 

Outcome: I now have a circle that cannot move out of the constrainted lines. It is now impossible for the user to go passed the lines. To make it more animated, the avatar will change colours at a rapid rate whilst also moving or stationary. I have also learnt that Constraint is a useful function that stops the avatar from moving to places it shouldn't, just like in video games where the game designer does not want the player to go past a certain area - stopping the player from proceeding the unallowed path.
