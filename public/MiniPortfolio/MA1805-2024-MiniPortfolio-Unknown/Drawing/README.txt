Inspiration: I wanted to create a simple target with an exiting twist where there are bullet holes. 

Struggles: I wasn't quite sure how to provide texture over the circles i had made, i orginally thought to use a normal JPEG image and use tint to make it transparent. 
However, this only covered the whole canvas without showing the circles. I then realised to use a transparent image in PNG file format to integrate it into the target.

Outcome: I now have a very clear target where the image is cleanly centered in the middle of the canvas
