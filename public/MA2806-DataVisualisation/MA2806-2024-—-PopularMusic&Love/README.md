Popular music and love:


Introduction to data:
Project demonstrates the correlation of popular music and love songs from 1965-2024. This is presented through fifteen year periods starting from 1965 - 2024.
Our dataset has been collected from the charts of Top 40 official UK charts (for the United Kingdom) and the Billboard Top 100 (for the United States), put into a spreadsheet that categorised the songs into position, title/artist and theme of the song. 
We display our data through an isotype style timeline, fitting all the songs into 4 categories: Romance, Heartbreak, Love for places and love for activities, other songs were omitted. 
The structure of the website shows all infomation on a one page scroll with central text, history and context of all years used before displaying our data through the timeline. 

Sources of inspiration:
Otto Neurath - creator of ISOTYPE, a method of showing connections in a pictorial form.


Group Organisation:
The groups main points of communication were a WhatsApp groupchat as well as email to transfer files. Held calls to discuss plans for the project and organised calls to push the project forward through combined efforts. 

Workload distribution: 
Ollie - Top 40 songs 1965, 1965 History and Context, coding on the website.

Amy - top 40 songs 2010 and 2024, uk and us, data collection, graphic design, 2024 History and Context 

Eoin - 1980 and 1995 data collection, 1980 and 1995 History and Context, coding on the website.

Jessica - Data presentation (lead in the development of the ISOTYPE timelines), 2010 History and Context. 

Challenges:
Finding lyrics and themes to lesser known songs that were released years ago (1965 particularly had this issue). 
Early process of website coding e.g text placement
The coding required to format the website to smaller screens
Glitch website operations (at times it was difficult to grant access to members due to issues on the Glitch website)
