## Project Summary
This data visualization project explores the growing influence and market presence of independent comics publishers in comparison to mainstream giants like Marvel and DC. Through interactive charts and contextual narratives, we analyze market share trends, genre diversity, digital vs. print sales, and the cultural impact of indie comics over the past decade.

- **MATT 2**: Data Analyst and Researcher - Gathered and processed datasets, performed analysis on trends and patterns, Researched the rise of indie comics, piracy, crowfunding etc
- **RHEA 3**: Content Writer - Researched and wrote all narrative content, ensured journalistic integrity
- **BAAR 4**: Lead UX Designer - Created layout structure, colour schemes, and interactive elements

## Design and Technical Challenges

### Technical Challenges
1. **Data Integration**: Merging datasets from different sources required normalization and careful validation to ensure consistent representations.
2. **Visualization Complexity**: Creating interactive visualizations that clearly communicate trends while remaining accessible to users with varying data literacy levels.
3. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring that complex visualizations remain functional and meaningful across device sizes.

### Design Approach
Our design philosophy centered on storytelling through data. We wanted to create a narrative arc that would guide users through the evolution of independent comics, using data visualizations as supporting evidence rather than isolated graphics. The color scheme was deliberately chosen to reflect the vibrant nature of comics while maintaining readability of the data.
