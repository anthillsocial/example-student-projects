## Project Summary
"What is Brewing Behind the Coffee Industry?" investigates the concealed labour, historical exploitation, and global inequalities embedded in the coffee trade. The project invites users to critically reflect on the production chain behind a beverage many consume daily, but rarely question. Through interactive, data-driven visualisations, we explore how physical labour, unfair wages, and colonial legacies continue to shape the coffee industry today.

Our website revolves around the themes of labour and trade, drawing from feminist data methodologies, creative prototyping, and accessible storytelling. It seeks to foreground often-overlooked perspectives—particularly those of racialised workers in the Global South—while critiquing the structural imbalances upheld by global trade.

Each visualisation contributes to this narrative:

- The first visualisation uses a stopwatch and coffee bean animation to physically represent labour: one coffee bean appears every six seconds, mirroring the estimated time required to hand-produce a single bean. This continues until it reaches 165 beans—the amount needed to make three espressos—reflecting Italy’s daily per capita consumption.

- The second visualisation, a pie chart built from coffee cups, visualises the income gaps coffee farmers face. It compares real wages to a living wage benchmark, highlighting how much is missing for farmers in countries like Colombia, Uganda, and Honduras to achieve a decent quality of life.

- The third visualisation, an interactive map, draws parallels between the transatlantic slave trade and modern coffee supply chains. Using curved lines, toggleable layers, and historical checkpoints, it visualises how extractive global trade patterns are not relics of the past but continue to shape economic flows and labour conditions today.

Ultimately, our project seeks to humanise data, using visual storytelling to foreground the labour behind everyday consumption and reveal how systems of inequality persist through time.


## Team Roles

**Christina B.**
- Contributed to the development and refinement of the project’s overarching narrative, ensuring thematic coherence across all visualisations.
- Created prototypes and evolution plans.
- Conducted in-depth data research for “The Transatlantic Slave Trade’s Influence on the Coffee Industry” visualisation to establish historical and economic connections between colonial trade routes and the modern coffee industry. I compiled and interpreted datasets accordingly.
- Written Content and Explanatory Texts
- Wrote explanatory content across the website, clearly communicating the context and significance of each visualisation.
- Technical aspects (coding):
  - Designed the visual identity of the website, selecting colour schemes, icons, and imagery, and to reinforce the theme of labour.
  - Embedded animations to maximise user experience.
  - Coded to ensure the functionality and accessibility of the website, contributing to a clear layout.
  - Created the Leaflet.js map and customised it with Lucia.
  - Added interactive buttons throughout the website for users to engage with.

**Lucia R.**
- Compiled all academic and visual references used in the project and integrated them into the website.
- Researched and proposed the overall structure of the website (sections, headers, and narrative flow), and came up with the idea to include interactive buttons that reveal additional facts to boost user engagement.
- Focused on the aesthetic direction of the site, selecting the colour palette and iconography.
- Ensured consistent storytelling around labour by choosing icons and visuals that supported the narrative.
- Coded the basic site structure, including navigation and section layout.
- Built scroll-based interactivity across the site.
- Collaborated with Christina on Map coding:
    - Developed the entire interactive map for the third visualisation using Leaflet.js.
    - Created toggle functionality to switch between multiple map layers (slave trade routes, coffee supply chains, and historical checkpoints).
    - Iteratively refined the map’s representation by adding custom curved routes and layered visuals to match the conceptual framework.


**Isabelle**
- Contributed to discussions about the visual aesthetic of the website, such as the layout structure.
- Conducted research on coffee production and the labour involved to develop a deeper understanding of the industry.
- Conducted initial research into the concept of the “Bean Belt” and proposed using a map as a visual element; although the map was ultimately not included, this research informed the development of ideas around transportation.
- The concept of Fairtrade and the hidden labour and exploitation of workers, which evolved into the “income gap”
- Carried out initial research into income standards and cost of living, which was later refined and expanded by Ivi using additional data.
- Created an animation illustrating the production process before transportation, accompanied by text.
- Researched methods for coding a stopwatch to visually represent the labour time behind each coffee bean, including reviewing similar websites for inspiration.
- Developed and coded the visual clock, integrating a timer and an image.
- Programmed the stopwatch to start in sync with the accompanying video when the “Start” button is pressed.

**Silvia D.** 
- Carried out all research and data collection for the "income gap" visualisation, identifying reliable sources to quantify what coffee farmers earn versus the income required for a decent standard of living.
- Created the Coffee Cups visualisation, using espresso cups combined with pie charts to represent the percentage farmers currently earn and the remaining gap to reach a decent living income.
- Wrote the explanatory text accompanying the "income gap" visualisation.
- Created the "coffee beans video" visualisation, animating one coffee bean every six seconds to illustrate the physical labour required to produce 165 beans, the amount used in three espressos.
- Participated in part of the data collection for the video, identifying the quantity of coffee beans in one espresso and how many espressos an average Italian drinks per day.
- Ensured the smooth technical integration of the "income gap" visualisation and the video on the website, fixing initial issues.
- Aligned all visual and narrative elements of the visualisations I created with the website’s overarching design, selecting colours, fonts, and iconography to maintain consistency with the labour-focused theme.


## Website Layout & Functionality
Our Website is deisgned to present key insights into the coffee industry, with a strong emphasis on its historical, economic, and ethical contexts. 
Below is an outline of how the website is laid out and how it functions:

1. Homepage
- The homepage serves as an introduction to the project, providing visitors with an overview of the themes explored in the visualisations and the website’s key objectives.
- The homepage includes an engaging introduction with interactive elements that encourage user engagement from the start. The layout is clean, minimalist, and easy to navigate, reflecting the project’s focus on clarity and accessibility.

2. Navigational Structure
- Introduction: A brief explanation of the project's goals, providing context for the data visualisations.
- Visualisations: Key interactive visualisations that provide detailed information about the coffee production process, wage disparities, and the historical context of the coffee trade.
- Historical Context: This section dives deeper into the transatlantic slave trade's role in the coffee industry, with maps and timelines that illustrate the global flow of coffee and its connections to slavery.
- Labour and Fairtrade: This area focuses on the labour involved in coffee production, highlighting the economic disparities and challenges faced by workers, with a special focus on living wages in coffee-producing countries.
- Statistics and Data: A collection of charts and graphs that provide insights into global coffee consumption patterns, imports, and trade flows.

3. Interactive Elements
- Stopwatch Feature: On the first visualisation, a stopwatch feature is used to highlight the time and effort involved in producing coffee. This interactive element allows users to engage with the data more physically, providing a tactile sense of the labour involved in coffee production.

- The map displays data about coffee trade flows, historical trade routes, and key labour and wage data.
  - Layered Map: The map includes toggleable layers that allow users to explore different types of data (e.g., coffee trade flows, wage disparities, historical checkpoints).
  - Custom Curved Lines: These lines represent trade routes and are designed to guide the user’s attention to key historical events related to the coffee industry.

- Icons: We’ve used simple, clear icons to maintain a consistent visual narrative. Icons for labour and consumers are designed to convey information clearly and impartially, contributing to the overarching storyline of the project.

4. Responsive Design: Interactivity is maintained across devices, ensuring that features like the map and stopwatch remain functional and user-friendly.

5. Prototyping and Iteration
- Prototyping was key to refining our visual concepts. We initially created basic mockups of the interactive elements (e.g., the stopwatch and map visualisations) to test their functionality and ensure they fit within the overall design aesthetic.
- This iterative process allowed us to refine features based on feedback and ensure that the final implementation was cohesive and aligned with the project’s goals.


## Design Approach

- A **vertical scrolling interface** was chosen to reflect a narrative journey.
- **Brown hues** symbolise coffee and soil.
- **Pan-African flag colours** in the slave trade visualisation honour Black history and Juneteenth.
- A **minimalist layout** with sans-serif fonts ensures content clarity.
- We avoided stereotypical or racialised visuals, instead opting for **neutral icons** like hands picking beans.

## Technical + Creative Challenges

- **Leaflet.js Learning Curve**: Christina and Lucia spent a lot of time refining the map's design, particularly focusing on creating custom curved lines to visually represent the historical and modern trade routes. These curved lines help to enhance the narrative, emphasising the geographical connections between the transatlantic slave trade and current coffee trade flows. 
- **".legacy"**: One of the challenges Christina and Lucia faced was figuring out how to modify the ".legacy" buttons for each toggle layer. This was a complex task, as we needed to ensure the buttons adapted dynamically based on the active layer, requiring careful attention to both functionality and visual consistency.
- **Data Volume**: Christina and Lucia had to simplify the slave trade map due to scale and time constraints.
- **Leaflet.js expand on hover effect**: Christina and Lucia had difficulties ensuring smooth hover effects with consumer and labour icons. With a lot of trial and layer we minimised the effect, but could not solve the glitch completely.
- **Collaborative Coding**: Maintaining synchronous updates across team members using Glitch required version control discipline.
- **Prototype-to-Final Transition**: Some visualisation prototypes were kept as final outcomes due to resource limitations, aligning with artistic prototyping principles. For example, we originally wanted to include all 8,000+ transatlantic slave trade routes in the interactive map. But the volume of data was too large for us to manage effectively, both technically and visually. Instead, we selected key routes that could clearly communicate the historical connections without overwhelming the design or the user experience.
- **CSS Animations**: Subtle CSS animations are used throughout the website to enhance the user experience without overwhelming the content. For example, hover effects on interactive elements and smooth transitions between different sections help maintain user engagement.

## Group Organisation & Communication

- **Platform**: WhatsApp was used for daily communication and quick updates. Zoom and in-person meetings supported detailed discussions.
- **Collaboration Tools**: Google Docs for shared research and planning; Glitch for collaborative coding.
- **Meeting Rhythm**: Met twice weekly during term time, with additional ad hoc meetings before deadlines.
- **Workload Distribution**: Tasks were divided based on individual strengths and interests. Weekly goals ensured balanced contribution.
- **Accountability**: Weekly check-ins kept everyone informed and allowed rebalancing if needed.

## Conflict Resolution & Inclusivity

- **Consensus Building**: Decisions made through open discussion or majority vote.
- **Conflict Handling**: If disagreements arose, the issue was first addressed in discussion. If unresolved, input from a tutor would be sought.
- **Inclusive Values**: We encouraged equal participation, respected diverse working styles, and created a supportive space for all members to contribute freely. We consistently checked in on whether anything needed to be added or changed on the website, ensuring everyone had the opportunity to contribute to the final build.
