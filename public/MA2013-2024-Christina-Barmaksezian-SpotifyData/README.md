# FINAL SPOTIFY PROJECT

## THEME
My project's theme is the importance of staying informed about data collection on digital platforms. Through a visual experience, the viewer explores Spotify through the data Spotify has gathered on me. The goal of the project is to awaken emotions of curiosity, unease, and confusion, encouraging the viewer to seek a deeper understanding of the phenomenon of today's society. Interfaces like Spotify collect users' personal data, share it with other platforms, and use it for tailored advertisements. While each individual has the right to determine their feelings regarding personal data collection, I see the importance of awareness of the types of information they could unknowingly share with online platforms we engage with daily. 

## USER INTERACTION WITH THE WEBSITE
For an optimal experience, please view the website in full screen. Also note that the project was designed using the dimensions of a 13-inch MacBook. If any elements appear misaligned, it may be due to variations in screen sizes on different devices. 

Upon opening the website, the viewer sees a Spotify login page. When the viewer hovers over the "username" and "password" bubbles, the bubbles slightly expand in size, indicating the viewer to fill out the bubbles. After logging in, the following page shows 14 Spotify playlists, each one named after a JSON file containing data Spotify provided me with. The playlists also slightly expand when the viewer hovers over them. When the viewer clicks on a playlist, a pop-up window opens with the data of that chosen JSON file. Through my data and sound, the viewer explores the depths of Spotify, specifically data collection. There is also an "Accept Cookies" bar below that the viewer should engage with.
